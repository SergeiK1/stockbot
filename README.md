Day Trading Strategy Using RSI and MACD:
Setup:

Chart Timeframe: 15-minute or 30-minute charts are recommended for day trading.
RSI Settings: Standard settings (14 periods with overbought level at 70 and oversold level at 30).
MACD Settings: Standard settings (12, 26, 9) - which represent the fast EMA, slow EMA, and the signal line respectively.
Entry Rules:

Buy Entry:

MACD: Wait for the MACD line to cross above the signal line, indicating bullish momentum.
RSI: Look for the RSI to move above 30, moving out of the oversold territory. This suggests that the recent downward momentum is slowing down, and a potential upward move could be coming.
Combined Signal: A buy signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and the RSI moves above 30 almost simultaneously or within a few bars of each other.
Sell/Short Entry:

MACD: Wait for the MACD line to cross below the signal line, indicating bearish momentum.
RSI: Look for the RSI to move below 70, moving out of the overbought territory. This suggests that the recent upward momentum is slowing down, and a potential downward move could be coming.
Combined Signal: A sell/short signal is generated when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, and the RSI moves below 70 almost simultaneously or within a few bars of each other.
Exit Rules:

Buy Trades: Exit the trade when the MACD line crosses below the signal line or when the RSI moves into the overbought territory (above 70), indicating potential overextension.
Sell/Short Trades: Exit the trade when the MACD line crosses above the signal line or when the RSI moves into the oversold territory (below 30), suggesting potential overextension.
Stop-Loss:

For buy trades, set a stop-loss below the recent swing low.
For sell/short trades, set a stop-loss above the recent swing high.
Risk Management:

Never risk more than 1-2% of your trading capital on a single trade.
Ensure that your potential reward is at least twice the amount you're risking (2:1 reward-to-risk ratio).
Final Thoughts:
This strategy combines the momentum detection capabilities of both the RSI and MACD. While the MACD identifies the general momentum direction, the RSI helps to pinpoint overbought or oversold conditions, providing a more refined entry or exit point.

However, like all trading strategies, this combination is not foolproof. It's essential to backtest the strategy on historical data and practice in a demo environment before going live. Additionally, always be aware of major news events or market conditions that might affect the asset you're trading, as these can influence the effectiveness of technical indicators.
